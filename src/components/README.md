A **component** is just a css class and every component dir contains an html file that examplify the component. <br>

<p>
    The css dir inside the component dir contains the stylesheet files required for the component 
<p>

<p>
    The js dir inside the component dir contains the js files required for the component
</p>

<p>
    If need, an img dir can be created to hold icons or images needed by the component.
</p>

So don' worries, since these file are imported in your projects, everything should works well. The only thing to worry about is that the css files or the html file expected to find an img dir relative to their file location.
